        <p>
            As you might've figured out already, my name is Oscar Nordquist, but something you probably didn't know is that I'm 19. I just started to study web-programming at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden. <br><br>
            Before I got the bright idea to move down here and study - I was living in Jönköping, which is located around 2,5 hours north from here.<br><br>
            My hobbies are currently some graphic design stuff - and playing computer games. But since we're at it, I also do hobby side projects in javascript.
